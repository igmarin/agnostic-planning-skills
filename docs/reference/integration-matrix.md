## Integrations by Skill

### requirements-clarifier

**Path:** `analysis/requirements-clarifier`

| Next | When |
|------|------|
| create-prd | After requirements are clarified and approved, draft the PRD |
| generate-tasks | If clarification uncovered concrete implementation tasks |

### create-prd

| Next | When |
|------|------|
| review-prd | Always after PRD draft — review for completeness and feasibility |
| generate-tasks | After PRD reviewed and approved |
| plan-tickets | If tickets needed directly from PRD scope |

### review-prd

| Next | When |
|------|------|
| generate-tasks | After review passes (Approved or Approved with Suggestions) |
| create-prd | If review returns Needs Revision — loop back to re-draft |
| tech-lead | For deeper feasibility and estimation quality assessment |

### generate-tasks

| Next | When |
|------|------|
| estimate-tasks | To assign effort estimates to the task breakdown |
| plan-tickets | If the same initiative needs ticket drafts |

### estimate-tasks

| Next | When |
|------|------|
| identify-risks | After estimation, to assess risks surfaced by high-uncertainty tasks |
| plan-sprint | To select tickets based on capacity vs estimates |

### identify-risks

| Next | When |
|------|------|
| generate-status-report | Include the risk register in stakeholder status updates |
| plan-tickets | If risks reveal new ticket dependencies |
| plan-sprint | Scan sprint plan for dependency and capacity risks |

### plan-tickets

| Next | When |
|------|------|
| prioritize-backlog | After tickets drafted, rank them for sprint selection |
| (Create in tracker) | After ticket drafts approved |
| github-issue | After ticket drafts approved, create as actual GitHub issues with labels, project board, and milestone |
| plan-sprint | Selected tickets feed into sprint planning |

### prioritize-backlog

| Next | When |
|------|------|
| plan-sprint | Use ordered backlog to select sprint candidates |
| plan-tickets | If newly prioritized items need ticket drafts |

### plan-sprint

| Next | When |
|------|------|
| generate-status-report | Report sprint progress to stakeholders |
| (Begin implementation) | Start working on sprint tickets |
| create-retrospective | After sprint ends, generate retrospective |

### generate-status-report

| Next | When |
|------|------|
| (Share with stakeholders) | After report approved |
| identify-risks | If report reveals new or escalating risks |
| create-retrospective | Status reports feed into end-of-sprint retrospective |

### github-issue

**Path:** `infrastructure/github-issue`

| Next | When |
|------|------|
| generate-status-report | After issues created, report progress to stakeholders |
| (Begin implementation) | After issues created and tracked |

### create-retrospective

| Next | When |
|------|------|
| plan-sprint | Action items feed into the next sprint plan |
| project-manager | Feed action items into execution tracking |

## Checkpoints and Gates

| Name | Type | Defined in | Purpose |
|------|------|------------|---------|
| PRD Approved | gate | create-prd, product-owner, delivery-lead | Don't generate tasks without approved PRD |
| Estimation Review | gate | estimate-tasks, project-manager | Don't proceed if >30% of tasks have low confidence |
| Risk Acceptance | gate | identify-risks, project-manager | Every High/High risk must have an owner and plan |
| Ticket Approved | gate | plan-tickets, product-owner | Don't create tracker issues without approval |
| Status Report Approved | gate | generate-status-report, project-manager | Don't share report without approval |
| Sprint Confirmed | gate | product-owner | Don't assume sprint placement |
| Sprint Commitment | gate | plan-sprint, delivery-lead | Don't proceed without committed sprint plan |
| Retrospective Complete | gate | create-retrospective, delivery-lead | Don't close cycle without action items |
