# Generating a PRD

**Goal:** Draft a PRD focusing on *what* and *why*, not *how*. No code.

## HARD-GATE
- No code, pseudo-code, SQL, class names, or method signatures.
- Do not generate tasks or code until the PRD is explicitly approved.

## Core Process
1. Receive feature description.
2. Clarify only if ambiguous — use up to 5 questions from [assets/prd_questions.md](./assets/prd_questions.md).
3. Draft using [PRD_TEMPLATE.md](./PRD_TEMPLATE.md) section by section.
4. Validate — present the PRD; get **explicit approval** before any implementation.

## Output
- Save to `/tasks/prd-<slug>.md` (kebab-case).
- Write requirements in natural language — no code.
- Request explicit approval; include next steps (e.g., "Run `generate-tasks` once approved").

## Integration
| Skill | When |
|-------|------|
| **generate-tasks** | After PRD approved |
| **plan-tickets** | When tracker tickets are needed from approved scope |
