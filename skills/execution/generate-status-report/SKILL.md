# Generating a Status Report

Produce a clear, honest status report.

## HARD-GATE
- Do not fabricate progress; unknown → "needs update".
- Do not hide blockers or risks.
- Use active voice; cite blockers with owners.

## Core Process
1. Gather task progress, sprint info, blockers, risk register.
2. Categorize items: Accomplished, In Progress, Blocked, Upcoming.
3. Write Executive Summary (2–4 sentences).
4. Fill sections: Accomplishments, In Progress, Blocked, Risks, Next Steps (see template).
5. Verify no status is fabricated.

## STATUS_REPORT_TEMPLATE
```markdown
# Status Report: [Project / Sprint Name]
**Period:** [Start] – [End]   **Prepared:** [Date]   **Author:** [Name]

## Executive Summary
**Health:** On Track | At Risk | Blocked
[2–4 sentences]

## Accomplishments
- [Task / milestone] — [context]

## In Progress
| Task | Owner | Status | ETA |

## Blocked
| Task | Blocker | Owner | Resolution Plan |

## Risks & Concerns
| # | Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Status Change |

## Next Steps
- [Action] — Owner: [Name], Due: [Date]
```

## Integration
- **identify-risks** for risk register
- **estimate-tasks** for effort references
