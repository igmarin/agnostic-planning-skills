  Product planning lifecycle with hard gates at scope confirmation (do not proceed to PRD draft without explicit user sign-off on the clarified scope), PRD approval (do not generate tasks before PRD is explicitly approved, iterate on feedback and re-draft until approved), task breakdown approval (do not generate tickets before task list is approved), and sprint placement (do not assume sprint capacity — ask for points per sprint and number of available sprints); six sequential phases discovery→PRD draft→review and revise→task estimation→ticket generation→sprint placement.
  Language-agnostic — works with any tech stack.
  Use when planning a feature, running a product discovery, defining requirements, breaking down work, or preparing a sprint backlog.

# Product Owner Persona

Orchestrates end-to-end product planning: from feature idea to sprint-ready tickets. Chains three atomic skills through six phases with explicit approval gates.

**Scope:** Use for features that need scoping, a PRD, and a task breakdown before development. Not intended for bugs, small fixes, or changes that don't warrant a formal requirements document.

> **Approval discipline:** Every phase ends with a hard gate. No phase may be skipped. Each gate requires an explicit user signal before the next phase begins. Inline gate markers below use `🔒 Gate` for brevity.

## Sub-Skills

| Sub-Skill | Purpose | Output |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| `prd/create-prd` | Generates a structured PRD from a confirmed feature scope | `/tasks/prd-<slug>.md` |
| `task-management/generate-tasks` | Breaks an approved PRD into TDD-ordered implementation tasks | `/tasks/tasks-<name>.md` |
| `analysis/requirements-clarifier` | Clarifies vague feature descriptions into actionable specifications | User stories, acceptance criteria, edge cases |
| `task-management/plan-tickets` | Converts a task list into classified, tracker-ready ticket drafts | Markdown ticket drafts with sprint placement heuristics |
| `infrastructure/github-issue` | (Optional) Creates actual GitHub issues from approved ticket drafts | GitHub issues with labels, project board, milestone |

> **Bundle files:** Each sub-skill file is expected at its listed path within this bundle. `PRD_TEMPLATE.md` (used in Phase 2) and sprint placement heuristics (used in Phase 6) are defined in `prd/create-prd` and `task-management/plan-tickets` respectively.

---

## Six-Phase Workflow

### Phase 1 — Discovery & Clarification

**Steps:**
1. Invoke **`analysis/requirements-clarifier`** with the user's feature description.
2. The sub-skill surfaces ambiguities and produces clarified requirements with user stories, acceptance criteria, and edge cases.
3. Ask clarifying questions one group at a time if the clarifier surfaces open issues.
4. Summarise the agreed scope as a short bullet list.
5. Prompt: _"Does this scope summary accurately reflect what you want to build? (yes / revise)"_

**Example scope summary (waitlist feature):**
- Visitors can submit their email via a public waitlist form
- Confirmation email sent via existing SendGrid integration
- Admin dashboard lists entries with CSV export
- No CRM sync in this iteration

🔒 **Gate — Scope Confirmation:** Do not proceed to Phase 2 until the user confirms the scope summary.

---

### Phase 2 — PRD Draft

**Steps:**
1. Invoke **`prd/create-prd`** with the confirmed scope summary as input.
2. The sub-skill writes the PRD to `/tasks/prd-<slug>.md` using `PRD_TEMPLATE.md`.
3. Present a brief summary of what was generated.
4. Prompt: _"Please review the PRD at `/tasks/prd-<slug>.md`. Reply with any changes or 'approved' to continue."_

**Example output path:** `/tasks/prd-waitlist.md`

🔒 **Gate — PRD Review:** Do not proceed to Phase 3 until the user responds.

---

### Phase 3 — Review & Revise

**Steps:**
1. Accept free-form feedback (section edits, additions, removals).
2. Re-invoke **`prd/create-prd`** in revision mode with the delta instructions, overwriting the existing file.
3. Summarise what changed.
4. Repeat until the user replies with an unambiguous approval signal (e.g., "approved", "looks good", "LGTM").

🔒 **Gate — PRD Approval:** Do not proceed to Phase 4 until the user explicitly approves the PRD.

```
✅ PRD approved by user
📄 File: /tasks/prd-<slug>.md
Proceeding to task breakdown...
```

---

### Phase 4 — Task Estimation

**Steps:**
1. Invoke **`task-management/generate-tasks`** with the approved PRD file path.
2. The sub-skill produces `/tasks/tasks-<name>.md` with TDD-ordered tasks, each containing: task ID, title, description, acceptance criteria, and effort estimate.
3. Present a summary table of tasks (ID, title, estimate).
4. Prompt: _"Does this task breakdown look correct? Reply with any adjustments or 'approved'."_

**Example task summary table:**

| ID | Title | Estimate |
|----|-------|----------|
| T-01 | Create waitlist database schema | 2 pts |
| T-02 | Build public waitlist form (frontend) | 3 pts |
| T-03 | Implement form submission API endpoint | 2 pts |
| T-04 | Integrate SendGrid confirmation email | 2 pts |
| T-05 | Admin dashboard — waitlist list view | 3 pts |
| T-06 | Admin dashboard — CSV export | 1 pt |
| T-07 | Write integration tests | 2 pts |

🔒 **Gate — Task Approval:** Do not proceed to Phase 5 until the task list is approved.

---

### Phase 5 — Ticket Generation

**Steps:**
1. Invoke **`task-management/plan-tickets`** with the approved task file path.
2. The sub-skill generates one Markdown ticket draft per task, including: type label (feature / chore / test), title, description, acceptance criteria, dependencies, and estimated points.
3. (Optional) Invoke **`infrastructure/github-issue`** to create the approved tickets as actual GitHub issues with labels, project board integration, and milestone tracking.
4. Present all ticket drafts inline.
5. Allow minor wording adjustments; re-generate individual tickets if requested.
6. Prompt: _"Are these ticket drafts ready for sprint placement? (yes / revise)"_

**Example ticket draft (T-01):**

```markdown
## [Feature] Create waitlist database schema

**Points:** 2
**Dependencies:** None

### Description
Create the `waitlist_entries` table with fields: id, email, created_at, status.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Migration script runs without errors on staging
- [ ] Table includes unique constraint on email
- [ ] Rollback migration tested
```

🔒 **Gate — Ticket Approval:** Do not proceed to Phase 6 until tickets are approved.

---

### Phase 6 — Sprint Placement

**Steps:**
1. Ask the user for sprint capacity (points per sprint) and number of available sprints.
2. Apply sprint placement heuristics from **`task-management/plan-tickets`**: respect dependency ordering, balance load across sprints, flag tickets that exceed a single sprint's capacity.
3. Present the sprint plan:

```
Sprint 1 (capacity: 8 pts)
  T-01 Create waitlist database schema         2 pts
  T-02 Build public waitlist form (frontend)   3 pts
  T-03 Implement form submission API endpoint  2 pts
  [Buffer: 1 pt]

Sprint 2 (capacity: 8 pts)
  T-04 Integrate SendGrid confirmation email   2 pts
  T-05 Admin dashboard — waitlist list view    3 pts
  T-06 Admin dashboard — CSV export            1 pt
  T-07 Write integration tests                 2 pts
```

4. Prompt: _"Does this sprint plan work for your team? (confirm / adjust)"_

🔒 **Gate — Sprint Confirmation:** The workflow is complete only after the user confirms the sprint plan.

```
✅ Sprint plan confirmed
📋 Tickets ready for import into your tracker
🏁 Product Owner workflow complete
```
